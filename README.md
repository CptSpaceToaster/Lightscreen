Lightscreen
===========

I'm getting sick and tired of lame presentation software that doesn't do cool things

The name will likely change soon.  There are a couple other project's named Lightscreen, so I should change mine.

###What's on the TODO List?
1. Barebones editor
1. Words on second monitor
1. Need Background
1. Launcher
1. Initial Alpha
